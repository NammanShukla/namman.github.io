# Personal Portfolio

## This repo contains my fresh grad portfolio which is made using react.js

#### 27/5/2024 - I have finished making the navbar and now i have to start with the actual contents of the site.

#### 28/5/2024 - Today, I grinded on the main contents of the page which included the About me and Projects. Doing the animations was fun as well as designing the whole thing was a delight since the documentation on bootstrap makes it easy. Likely will move on without the skills section as i think it is irrelevant, I added the Resume to the site which is more relevant in the grand scheme of things.

#### 07/06/2024 - This session was about making the projects slider have more information on demand, to do so i added CTA buttons which opened a modal on the page containing the additional details. using the DOM traversal, i was able to add this feature ! very fun to figure out and play around with :)

#### 09/06/2024 - For today, I was in a call with my friends to ask for feedback on the website as well as I added information on the project's modals. I have ideas to make the website better i.e. add more stuff to the about me section... 

### 15/06/24 - This week, I took much needed rest while working on the views of the website, for now the website should look okay on 1080p and 4k (maybe some laptops too). I also hide the navigation section as i feel like the website is not big enough to have a navigation bar, making it useless in my opinion.
