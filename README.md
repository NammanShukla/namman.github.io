# Personal Portfolio

## This repo contains my fresh grad portfolio which is made using react.js

#### 27/5/2024 - I have finished making the navbar and now i have to start with the actual contents of the site.

### 28/5/2024 - Today, I grinded on the main contents of the page which included the About me and Projects. Doing the animations was fun as well as designing the whole thing was a delight since the documentation on bootstrap makes it easy. 
Likely will move on without the skills section as i think it is irrelevant, I added the Resume to the site which is more relevant in the grand scheme of things.
